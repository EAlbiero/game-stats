# game-stats
Some random statistics/simulations I've coded based on games I play. Below you will find a brief description on what each of them do.

## cs_map_balance
In competitive Counter-Strike, one team picks the map played while the other chooses the starting side. If a map is known to be CT-sided (or T-sided), it's generally recommended to start as the side with a higher winrate percentage. I've always found it curious since teams switch sides halfway through the match, so this contains a simulation of a game with varying values for the winrate percentage. Matches have overtime by default.
